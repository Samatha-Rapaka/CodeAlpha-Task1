<h1>Hangman Game in Python</h1>
In this tutorial, we will create a simple hangman game in Python. The game will randomly select a word from a pre-defined list of words and the player will have to guess the word by guessing individual letters. The game will keep track of the number of lives remaining and will display ASCII art corresponding to the number of lives remaining. The game will end when the word has been fully guessed or when the player runs out of lives.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
- Basic knowledge of Python programming<br>
- Familiarity with loops and conditional statements
